# Wireless-Voice-Controlled-Robot-with-Live-Streaming-Video
- We have designed a speech controlled robot to command wirelessly from a distant place with real-time live video streaming capability. It can also avoid obstacle.</br>
- For wireless communication, we have used ZigBee protocol for any distance and a BitVoicer software for voice recognition. </br>
- The robot by a voice command of any person independent of male, female, adult or children from a pc. </br>
- The voice command is received by microphone then we have designed a software which converts this analog voice to digital command then it sends via a wireless ZigBee protocol to a receiver.</br>
- The live streaming video with audio  is transmitted from a  wireless camera to pc.</br>
# Application 
- For human rescue operations helping fire brigade to work safely. Fire brigade team can use this robot to find out the presence of human inside the fire accident place. 
- Fire brigade team can also use this robot to find out the presence of human inside the destructed building due to an earthquake or for any reason.
- Military operations for visualizing enemy territory from a safe distance and also getting information from the unsecured place.
